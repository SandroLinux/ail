# Authorial Integrity License
This license is meant to protect certain rights of the original authors of a work, while granting the ability to downstream creatives to remix, redistribute, and have fun with the work.

## Why prohibit the use of neural networks/AI/etc?
This license is intended to protect the integrity of the author and their original vision. Other licenses allow for the work of the author to be used in a means that could produce a 'deep fake' or other build.

## How to use this license in your own project
Use `TEMPLATE`, filling in your name (or your organizations name) and the title of the project. Ensure that your work includes this license in some way. Be it on your website, in the metadata, or within the work itself.
