# Authorial Integrity License
This license is meant to protect certain rights of the original authors of a work, while granting the ability to downstream creatives to remix, redistribute, and have fun with the work.

## Why prohibit the use of neural networks/AI/etc?
This license is intended to protect the integrity of the author and their original vision. Other licenses allow for the work of the author to be used in a means that could produce a 'deep fake' or other build.

## How to use this license in your own project
Use `TEMPLATE`, filling in your name (or your organizations name) and the title of the project. Ensure that your work includes this license in some way. Be it on your website, in the metadata, or within the work itself.

### Intent
      The intent of this license is to preserve the integrity of the Author’s message, their
      intent, and the context of the Author’s protected Work.

      This license should not be interpreted as a means of shielding the Author or the Work
      from criticism, parody, satire, or other protected speech.

      The abuse thereof would constitute an unauthorized remix of these terms (this document
      is recursively licensed) and would result in a nullification of Author’s right to apply
      these terms to their own Work.

      (See Section 2.2 Remixes)
