Authorial Integrity License v 0.3
Copyright 2018 - [AUTHOR'S NAME]

1. License
	The [TITLE OF PROTECTED WORK] (the Work) is made available free of charge to any 
	Individual for personal consumption.

	The Author hereby grants a license to any Creative to freely use, sample, remix, 
	or redistribute the Work so long as the conditions laid out in Limitations (Section
	2) are observed.

2. Limitations
	2.1 Copyleft Integrity
	    Redistribution of the Work is permitted, except in the following instances:
	    	• Linking to or embedding the Work using thumbnails, headlines, or body copy
		  which mislead or Misrepresent the Spirit or Message of the Author.
      		• The Work must remain intact as it was published by the Author. Omission of
		  Sponsored or Paid Content constitutes a Derivative Work. (See Section 2.2)
	2.2 Derivative Works
	    The Creative may sample portions of the Original Content except when Derivative works:
      		• Violate the spirit of the Original Content.
      		• Change, subvert, or misrepresent the Spirit, Original Message, or intent of 
		  the Author.
      		• Include Sponsored or Paid Content in part or in full.
	2.3 Prohibited Usage:
	    The use of the Work for the purpose of training neural networks, artificial
	    intelligence, computer learning algorithms, or voice recognition software is
	    expressly forbidden.
      		• Voice recognition software for the purpose of creating text transcripts
		  of the Work is allowed if:
          		◦ The terms of Derivative Works (Section 2.2) are met AND
          		◦ Computational voice models are not generated or stored

3. Consent
      The terms of this license apply to all Derivative Works. Any Creative who makes a
      Derivative Work using the Original Content—or who Redistributes the Work—agrees to be
      bound by the terms laid out in this document.

      Failure to comply with these terms will result in the Creative having their license
      to use the work rescinded, past and future licenses from the same Author nullified
      (at the Author’s discretion), and possible legal action taken on behalf of the Author.

4. Intent
      The intent of this license is to preserve the integrity of the Author’s message, their
      intent, and the context of the Author’s protected Work.

      This license should not be interpreted as a means of shielding the Author or the Work
      from criticism, parody, satire, or other protected speech.

      The abuse thereof would constitute an unauthorized remix of these terms (this document
      is recursively licensed) and would result in a nullification of Author’s right to apply
      these terms to their own Work.

      (See Section 2.2 Remixes)
